Dependencies:
-------------
EGRET requires Python 3.4 or later (due to using re.fullmatch).
Python 2.x versions will not work.

Setup directions:
-----------------

1. Execute: `cd src`

2. You may need to modify these Makefile variables:  
`CXX      := g++`  
`PYTHON   := python3`  
`EXT_PATH := build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.4`  
`EXT_LIB  := egret_ext.cpython-34m.so`  

  The latter two variables refer to the location and name of a library that is created.
The library contains C++ code but is used as a Python module. The precise name of the
path and library may vary. To find out the name, simply make the project once and then
analyze the build subdirectory that is created.
 
3. Execute: `make`

4. Execute: `cd ..`

5. You should see the library (the `egret_ext.cpython-34m.so` or similar file) in this directory.

Running:
--------
Simply run `python3 egret.py`.  It will prompt for a regular expression and then generate
test strings.

The script also some command line options.  To see a list, execute: `python3 egret.py -h`
